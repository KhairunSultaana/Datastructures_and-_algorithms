/*How It Works
candidate: Tracks the current majority candidate.
count: Tracks the frequency balance for the candidate.
Loop:
Reset candidate if count becomes 0.
Increment or decrement count based on whether the element matches the candidate.
Example
Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 2

This is clean, efficient, and ready for coding interviews. Let me know if you want a further explanation!*/
